# Bluechilli ChilliFront Installer

This is the auto-installer script for [Bluechilli's](https://github.com/BlueChilli) Front-end platform.

## How to use

```shell
npx bc-starter-template <project-directory>
```

You'll be prompted to select modules and off you go from there!

## Flags

There two flags available for you to use. You can use them together too if you like.

- `-m` or `--only-modules` : This shows a prompt to the user select modules and install them and their dependencies
- `-s` or `--only-styles` : This installs the latest version of style helpers to the target directory

As usual, you can use `npx bc-starter-template --help` for help directly in the terminal

## Documentation

You can read the detailed documentation for components and modules on [CS.Front.Modules](https://bluechilli.github.io/ChilliSource.Front.Modules/).
